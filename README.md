* Intro
I'm a little lazy now, you can get help by using =clsw -h= or read the script code.
Maybe I will make a detailed introduction in the future.

Many file I used in color switching were not uploaded, but I think you can modify it to fit you.

* Add new apps
  - Find the lines you need to modify and the key string.
  - Google how to reload that app's configuration on the fly.
    I have add some apps like copyq, dunst, emacs, fcitx, GTK, i3, other, qt5ct, qutebrowser, rofi, termite, alacritty.
  - Add them into script and mode file.
